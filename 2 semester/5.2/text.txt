You might be astonished by the amount of information stored about you in computer database. You bank has information on your financial status, credit history, and the people, organizations, and businesses to which you write checks. School records indicate something about your ability to learn and the subjects that interest you.
Medical records indicate the state of your health. Credit card companies track the places you shop and what you purchase in person, by main, or on the Web. Your phone company stored your phone number, your address, and a list of the phone numbers you dial. The driver’s license bureau has your physical description. Your internet cookies track many of the Web sites you frequent.
By compiling this data-a process sometimes referred to as “profiling’-an interested person or company could guess some very privet things about you, such as your political views or even your sexual orientation.
